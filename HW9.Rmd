Q2. (5 points)
Create your own R package called jed408 and embed the following function:

go_cats <- function(){
  # sample function that returns 'go cats'
  # RETURNS: string saying 'go cats'
  return('go cats')
}
To verify this works, run the following command:

```{r}

jed408::go_cats()

jed408::MonteHallMonteCarlo(10, T)

```
